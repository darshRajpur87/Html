            <h2>Introducation</h2>
            <p>
                Dracula is a novel by Bram Stoker, published in 1897. An epistolary novel, the narrative is related through letters, diary entries, and newspaper articles. It has no single protagonist and opens with solicitor Jonathan Harker taking a business trip to stay at the castle of a Transylvanian nobleman, Count Dracula. Harker escapes the castle after discovering that Dracula is a vampire, and the Count moves to England and plagues the seaside town of Whitby. A small group, led by Abraham Van Helsing, investigate, hunt and kill Dracula.<br/>

            <h2>More on ...</h2>
            <p>Dracula was mostly written in the 1890s. Stoker produced over a hundred pages of notes for the novel, drawing extensively from Transylvanian folklore and history. Some scholars have suggested that the character of Dracula was inspired by historical figures like the Wallachian prince Vlad the Impaler or the countess Elizabeth Báthory, but there is widespread disagreement. Stoker's notes mention neither figure. He found the name Dracula in Whitby's public library while on holiday, thinking it meant devil in Romanian.</p>

            <h2>Some additional information</h2>
            <p>Dracula was not the first piece of literature to depict vampires,[142] but the novel has nonetheless come to dominate both popular and scholarly treatments of vampire fiction.[53] Count Dracula is the first character to come to mind when people discuss vampires. [143] Dracula succeeded by drawing together folklore, legend, vampire fiction and the conventions of the Gothic novel.[142] Wendy Doniger described the novel as vampire literature's "centrepiece, rendering all other vampires BS or AS".[144][r] It profoundly shaped the popular understanding of how vampires function, including their strengths, weaknesses, and other characteristics.[145] Bats had been associated with vampires before Dracula as a result of the vampire bat's existence—for example, Varney the Vampire (1847) included an image of a bat on its cover illustration. But Stoker deepened the association by making Dracula able to transform into one.</p>

            <h2>Gender and sexuality</h2>
            <p>Gender and sexuality
                Academic analyses of Dracula as sexually charged have become so frequent that a cottage industry has developed around the topic.[56] Sexuality and seduction are two of the novel's most frequently discussed themes, especially as it relates to the corruption of English womanhood.[57] Modern critical writings about vampirism widely acknowledge its link to sex and sexuality.[58] Bram Stoker himself was possibly homosexual; Talia Schaffer points to intensely homoerotic letters sent by him to the American poet Walt Whitman.[59] Stoker began writing the novel one month following the imprisonment of his friend Oscar Wilde for homosexuality.[60</p>
